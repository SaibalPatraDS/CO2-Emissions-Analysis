# CO2-Emissions-Analysis
Creating a detailed analysis of co2 emissions.


## Description 
Vehicle manufacturers now use the 5-cycle testing procedure, introduced for model year 2015, to determine the fuel consumption ratings of new light-duty vehicles. 5-cycle testing produces fuel consumption ratings that are more representative of a vehicle? on-road fuel consumption. To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the ratings for 1995 to 2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing.
