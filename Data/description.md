## Understanding the table

### Transmission : A = automatic
	       1 -> 10 = Number of gears

### Fuel type : B = Electricity

### Consumption : The combined fuel consumption rating reflects 55% city and 45% highway driving. 
              Le is gasoline litre equivalent. One litre of gasoline contains the energy equivalent to 8.9 kWh of electricity.


### CO2 emissions : the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving.
### CO2 rating : the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
### Smog rating : the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
### Range : the estimated driving distance (in kilometres) on a fully charged battery
### Recharge time : the estimated time (in hours) to fully recharge the battery at 240 volts
